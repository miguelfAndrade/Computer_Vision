# Computer_Vision

In this project i used Processing 3 to create a game that the player can control a space ship with his movement in front of a computer camera. The player can also shoot bullets making a sound that is captured in the computer microphone.

The concept of the game is similar to a tipical arcade space shooter game, but with some differences:

- In the beginning the player has 10 lifes and 0 points.
- There is four types of enemies and four types of bullets. Each bullet can only destroy the respective enemy.
- The player must prevent them to reach the bottom of the screen by destroing them.
- At the same time the player must try to catch the other falling items to get points.
- If a bomb reachs the bottom of the screen, the player loses 1 life. When the lifes are equal to 0, the game ends.

The player has to gain the max points possible before his life reaches 0.
